####Dimensioning####
The scripts in this directory implement the best waveform design algorithms 
for both frequency time analysis and range time analysis.

#Design_f_t_helic_2dfft.m
#Design_f_t_quad_2dfft.m
By set up the input drone (quad = quadopter, helic = helicopter) and radar parameters the algorithm return as output 
the final best radar and waveform parameters for each possible STFT window width with NO overlapping among windows.

#Design_f_t_helicopter.m
#Design_f_t_quadcopter.m
By set up the input drone (quad = quadopter, helic = helicopter) and radar parameters the algorithm return as output 
the best radar and waveform parameters for each possible STFT window width with 50% overlapping among windows.

#Design_rho_t_helicopter.m
#Design_rho_t_quadcopeter.m
By set up the input drone (quad = quadopter, helic = helicopter) and radar parameters the algorithm return as output 
the best radar and waveform parameters for the range-time analysis.

#FMCW_parameters.m
By setting the radar working frequency and range resolution, returns in output the necessary sampling freqeuncy 
and chirp duration in order to avoid range cell migration. Returns also the chirp values that involve range
cell migration and the value of that migration.




####Drone received signal####
The scripts in this directory simulate the received signal from drone, and then the typical FMCW radar processing is applied
and both the range profile and the spectrogram are obtained.

#erfz.m
Error function matlab implementation.

#helicopter_drone_simulator.m
#quadcopter_drone_simulator.m
Simulated drone's received signal with Chen and Kulpa model. (Ligresti code adapted to FMCW radar).

#integrale_pala_prova.m
Simulation of the received signal from drone trying to make the integral of each infinitesimal rotor blade contribution. (The obtained result is not as we expect).

#received_signal_helic_ft_no_overlap.m
#received_signal_quad_ft_no_overlap.m
Simulation of drone's received signal with defined thesis model. Then on the received signal the FMCW 2DFFT processing is perfomed 
with no overlap among windwos on the second FFT cycle. The freqeuncy-time observation is obtained.

#spectrogram_overlap_N_mezzi.m
Simulation of drone's received signal with defined thesis model. Then on the received signal the FMCW 2DFFT processing is perfomed 
with 50% of overlap among windwos on the second FFT cycle. The freqeuncy-time observation is obtained.

#spectogram_overlap_75_percent.m
Simulation of drone's received signal with defined thesis model. Then on the received signal the FMCW 2DFFT processing is perfomed 
with 75% of overlap among windwos on the second FFT cycle. The freqeuncy-time observation is obtained.

#received_signal_helic_rho_t.m
#received_signal_quad_rho_t.m
Simulation of drone's received signal with defined thesis model. Then on the received signal the Range-Time 
plane is constructed.




####Range migration effect####
Some calculations about the range migration effect in order to visualize how the chirp duration determines 
the occurrence of this effect.	

#range_migration_helicopter
#range_migration_quadcopter
Simulation of theoretical formulas of range variations of rotor blade (circular motion), visualization of the characteristic range trend in the presence of the migration effect and not.




####Surveillance Radar Equation####
Implementation of radar surveillance equation in generic case and in FMCW radar case in order to obtain some unkonw parameters given 
other parameters.

#cw_surveillance_radar_equation.m
Continuous wave radar surveillance equation, computation of radar parameters given the known ones.

#mean_power_requirements.m
Computation of mean power required from a FMCW radar given as input all the other radar parameters.

#radar_surveillance_equation.m
Generic radar surveillance equation implementation.
